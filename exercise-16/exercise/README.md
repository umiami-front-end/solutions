### Instructions

In `contact.html`, create a form which collects the following information:

- Name
- Address
- Phone
- E-mail

Use HTML5 input types for phone and e-mail.

In `contact.js`, write a script which collects the data from the form you created and display it in the template provided within `contact.html`. If the email field is empty, the user should not be able to submit the form.

When a user clicks 'submit', the user's data should appear within the `span` tags. You may not change the existing HTML.

**BONUS:** Add a button which allows the user to reset all of the form fields.
